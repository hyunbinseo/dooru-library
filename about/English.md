# About the Library

Good books are essential for the independent growth and learning of children.

While there is no shortage of quality options in the Korean children's book market, books geared towards those who are familiarizing themselves with Korean can be hard to find. Furthermore, step-by-step books for intellectually and emotionally developed children who are learning Korean can be especially rare.

Reading and writing skills must be cultivated from an early age through a variety of stimulating activities. However, this is not always feasible for some children depending on their family's economic status, or their parents' Korean fluency, interests, available resources, etc. For these children, quality learning materials are especially necessary.

The Digital Library project was conceived by The Foundation SeeArt for Book Culture and the educational tech start-up Enuma to provide quality books for children who need them.

Korea is transitioning into a multicultural society, and though there are many existing services that aim to help children from immigrant backgrounds become contributing members of society, there's always room for improved support.

Enuma is an educational software company founded by Koreans in the United States. As a result, many of Enuma's staff members have firsthand experience of the difficulties families face in helping their children adjust culturally and academically. Enuma builds from these experiences to create learning materials that help children from multicultural families learn to read and write while also preparing them for academic life.

The Foundation SeeArt for Book Culture and Enuma created the Dooru Library with the following objectives.

1. To provide word books, books with simple phrases, reading material for 1st graders, 2nd graders, and everything in between to support readers at every level.
2. To provide books with appropriate themes that consider the reader's intellectual and emotional development.
3. To provide books that showcase the unique folktales, lifestyles, customs, and traditions of different countries in consideration of children of immigrant backgrounds.
4. Free access for everyone.

It's the hope of The Foundation SeeArt for Book Culture and Enuma that the Dooru Library app grows its resources in order to provide support for anyone seeking to improve their Korean literacy skills.
